Hello Raksha, Thank you so much for giving us this wonderful and valuable opportunity to learn yoga in such a simple and easy way. This is my first yoga class and i have learnt alot. These exercises were easy but very effective. I am finding myself very energetic and light during the whole day.. The cooking session was also awesome. Since i am foodie, it will take some time to get in yogic food mode. The only problem faced by me was only to wake up so early morning. Will certainly complete 1 mandala to find out more changes in myself.. Thanks alot once again. Pls take care of yourself.
